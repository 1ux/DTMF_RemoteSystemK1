/*
Library overview:

This Arduino library implements the funtamental functionality of DCF77.
The focus is on clean code and minimalism rather than large functionality.
This set of functions supports the decoding of: Minute, Hour, Day, Month and Year.
In addition, transmission errors are checked via the even parity and the 15 bit ("call bit") 
is queried to rule out problems with the transmitter.
A DCF77 receiver module is required. 
This module demodulates the AM long wave signal from Germany 
and generates 59 square wave pulses with two different duty cycles.
